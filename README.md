# IntKit

This repo is created in order to have a quick reference for any algorithms, Data structures and interesting programming or technical questions related to programming.
Feel free to add the code and please follow the below guidelines:
1) Create a directory based on the language in the source directory.

    E.g:
    
        If you are developing the code in python, create a directory in the source directory as below if it does not exist.
            intKit/python

2) Create a branch in local fork and do not push the code from the master branch.

3) Add a test code for every main code and tests should pass irrespective of languages.

4) Redundant code between different languages is fine.

5) Create sub-directories in the language directories if necessary.

6) Please don't add unnecessary files like .idea. Add these files in the file .gitignore and push it
